Ally-Py
=======

[Ally-Py][Ally-Py] Ally-Py is a flexible, rapid development framework for developers who want to build any web based application with a REST API.
It follows the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle and has its main focus on API, unlike other frameworks where the API is an afterthought. Not only that, the framework can create any API, not just REST. So if in the future you want to switch to a new type of API (not REST) it can be done very easily, without having to change the application business logic.
